A simple game that stores objects with an age attribute, selects two and conveys them to the user who is prompted to select which they think is older. Score is tracked and displayed, rounds to play for can be set, etc.

Program basically functional. Tracks user score, always picks two distinct items.

#Missing stuff/things to expand:

-Actually making use of 'fact' attribute

#Issues:

-Has no way to handle years entered before AD
-Has no way to handle items with the same year value
